### 💻 Project

My Food Fact is a data-driven web application designed to provide comprehensive information about various food items. Built using a modern tech stack, including ReactJS, Vite, and TypeScript, the app offers a clean and intuitive user interface powered by Tailwind CSS and Flowbite React. By consuming the FOOD FACTS API, the app dynamically fetches and displays a vast array of food data. Users can easily search for specific food items, navigate through paginated results, and access detailed information. The development process is streamlined with tools like Axios for API requests, React Query for efficient data fetching and caching, and ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency.
